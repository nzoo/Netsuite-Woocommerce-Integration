# Nesuite-WooCommerce-Integration
The project involves the integration of Netsuite Woocommerce with Salesforce.  It consists of two major parts: an administrator console and a set of customizations made to the existing project. 
This code sample assumes that you have already loaded the necessary NetSuite API client library, have the necessary NetSuite credentials, and are able to retrieve order data from WooCommerce. The get_woocommerce_order_data and convert_to_ns_sales_order functions will need to be implemented to match your specific setup.
